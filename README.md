# Garden of Life

This is an app I made to learn Elixir and Phoenix. The idea is take [Conway's Game of Life]() and allow multiple players to add cells (flowers) to a single grid (a plot in a garden). Eventually I might allow players to add different automata that work by different rules (for example, grass that only spreads or paths that never change).

## Running the app

To start your Phoenix server:

  * Run `mix setup` to install and setup dependencies
  * Start Phoenix endpoint with `mix phx.server` or inside IEx with `iex -S mix phx.server`

Now you can visit [`localhost:4000`](http://localhost:4000) from your browser.
